MGH Mouse Behavior Analysis

problem definition: Dr.Shiqian's lab has generated some mouse behavior data that are stored in the form of videos. From the video, he observed dramatic differences between groups of mice in terms of their mating behavior, food eating behavior, and grooming behavior. We need to analyze those data in a quantitative way to get the behavioral characteristics of mice in the above aspects.
We separate this project into two parts: Food Preference part and Pursuit part. We will introduce the methods we take and the results we get in each of them.
