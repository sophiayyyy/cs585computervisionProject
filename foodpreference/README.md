1.test store an example video we cut from the original video because the original video is too big
2.output has all the result we get
3.for all the videos we use foodpreference.cpp to get the result but for some videos named with 'sham' we use backup.cpp to get the result which contains the input file named foodlocation.txt that we mark the food  locations manually because in those videos the mouse moves the food a lot.
4.After we get the confindentvalue.txt we use food.m to get the chart. Please change the data and path_in with you own path.
